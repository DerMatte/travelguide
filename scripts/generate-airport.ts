  return `You are an expert travel researcher creating the single best, most practical one-page guide for ${normalizedIata} airport.

Write in clean, scannable Markdown.

Start with YAML frontmatter in this exact shape:

---
iata: "${normalizedIata}"
name: "Full official airport name"
city: "City"
country: "Country"
lastUpdated: "${today}"
sources:
  - "https://official-airport-site.example"
  - "https://relevant-security-or-transport-authority.example"
quickFacts:
  - "4-6 short bullet facts as YAML strings"
bentoTips:
  - category: "timing"
    label: "Timing"
    title: "Short imperative headline"
    summary: "One-sentence takeaway a traveler can act on."
    detail: "One extra sentence of context (when it applies, what to avoid)."
---

Include exactly 4 bentoTips, one for each category in this order: "timing", "terminal", "food", "status". Each label is a 1-2 word display tag (e.g. "Timing", "Transfers", "Food & quiet", "Live checks"). These are the highest-signal tips for this airport — they are shown prominently, so do not waste them on generic advice.

Then continue with the page body using this exact heading structure:

# ${normalizedIata} Airport Guide

> One-sentence high-signal summary focused on why this page is useful.

## Quick Facts
- Bullet list of 4-6 truly important facts (terminals, major airlines, unique characteristics).

## Security & Screening Tips
- The most important, actionable security advice specific to this airport (TSA or local equivalent, PreCheck/Clear status, known pain points, times of day to avoid).

## Best Airport Tricks & Hacks
- 5-8 genuinely clever, practical tricks that experienced travelers actually use here. Be specific. Include context ("works best when...", "avoid if...").

## Terminals & Navigation
- High-level but useful navigation guidance, walking times, best connections, common mistakes.

## Lounges, Food & Amenities
- Honest recommendations of the actually good options (not just paid advertising). Call out standout food or quiet spots.

## Ground Transport & Parking
- Practical advice on the best ways in/out, costs, and insider timing tips.

## Official Sources
- List the key official links travelers should bookmark.

Tone: Direct, slightly opinionated, zero fluff. Prioritize traveler time-saving and stress reduction.
Use real official URLs in frontmatter sources whenever possible.
